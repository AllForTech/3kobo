# 3Kobo

3Kobo is an open-source EdTech and language infrastructure project focused on improving access to technology education by localizing technical vocabularies into African languages.

The project currently focuses on Nigeria’s three major languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.

## Why 3Kobo?

Millions of learners in Africa struggle to access technology education due to language barriers. Most digital learning content is delivered in English, limiting comprehension, retention, and participation for children and youth in low-resource settings.

3Kobo addresses this by building standardized, validated, and openly accessible technical vocabularies that educators, students, and EdTech platforms can use to teach and learn in local languages.

## What We Build

- Open, validated multilingual tech vocabularies
- APIs for integrating localized terms into EdTech platforms
- Crowdsourced data collection tools
- Deduplication and validation engines
- Contributor reward mechanisms
- Open datasets for education and research
